For my final project I decided to try something that has been piquing my interest for quite some time now. That being 2.5d. Where 2d images/ sprites are placed within a 3d world.
For my environment I was using the GameMaker platform. I use it a lot for hobby projects and whatever build for this project I can hopefully translate into future ones. The engine is also quite similar to how p5js functions. That is objects have a create and draw function where nearly all the code is placed. As such, translating my skills from class was pretty seemless.

I am making a small simple scene of a river that can be moved around a bit. Nothing too major. No interaction besides moving the fairy sprite around.

This current draft of the project is still very much just a skeleton. At this point I want to mainly add some more post proccessing effects via shaders and I also need to update my textures. Right now I am just using solid colors. I also may expand the scene in someway so that there isn't all this white showing.

Going into this I did not realize how manu new graphics topics I would have to learn. I think something like Unity would have been a better engine for this ha ha. But I stuck with what I'm comfortable with. I've definitly been following a lot of youtube tutorials for this project. Various previous weekly assignment I feel slowly got me comfortable with all the new coding problem's I've had to learn. I definitly think if I tried making this project a few months back I would get overwhelmed and quit.
