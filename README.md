For my final project I decided to try something that has been piquing my interest for quite some time now. That being 2.5d. Where 2d images/ sprites are placed within a 3d world.
For my environment I was using the GameMaker platform. I use it a lot for hobby projects and whatever build for this project I can hopefully translate into future ones. The engine is also quite similar to how p5js functions. That is objects have a create and draw function where nearly all the code is placed. As such, translating my skills from class was pretty seemless.

I am making a small simple scene of a river that can be moved around a bit. Nothing too major. No interaction besides moving the fairy sprite around.

This current draft of the project is still very much just a skeleton. At this point I want to mainly add some more post proccessing effects via shaders and I also need to update my textures. Right now I am just using solid colors. I also may expand the scene in someway so that there isn't all this white showing.

Going into this I did not realize how manu new graphics topics I would have to learn. I think something like Unity would have been a better engine for this ha ha. But I stuck with what I'm comfortable with. I've definitly been following a lot of youtube tutorials for this project. Various previous weekly assignment I feel slowly got me comfortable with all the new coding problem's I've had to learn. I definitly think if I tried making this project a few months back I would get overwhelmed and quit.

This also is just a bit more low level then I'm used to working with. I've been using a lot of shaders. But another big thing was learning how 3d shapes are made. I physically sketched out vertices on paper and how they would form cubes. So the 3d shapes are all made via code, line by line. Is this the best way for 3d shapes, probably not, but it was a good learning experience that eased me into how everything worked. 

Also most of the code I didn't write but more so found online and took some time understanding how it worked.
